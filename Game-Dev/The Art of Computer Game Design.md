# Chapter 1: What is a Game?

One obstacle to understanding game design is the perception of what a game really is. Complete amateurs who's only experiences are programming, narration, or graphic design will take no further preparation than their own experience as game players. Those who overestimate their own understanding will undercut their own potential for learning.

The second obstacle is ambiguity. Game designers have no well defined set of common terms with which to communicate with each other. Discussions quickly turn into arguments over semantics. The principles and concepts of gaming are so wide that we have watered down their meanings. 

## Board Games
Board games consist of playing surfaces divided into sectors populated by a set of movable pieces. These pieces are associated with the players, while the playing surface represents the environment outside of the players' control. 

Players move their pieces across the surface in an effort to achieve some kind of goal, such as capturing pieces, gaining territory, or acquiring an object. The player's primary concern is the analysis of geometrical relationships between the pieces.

## Card Games
These games use a set of 52 symbols generated from two factors: rank (13 values) and suit (4 values). These games revolve around combinations built from these two factors. Players may gain or lose possession of symbols either by random process or by matching some combination allowed by the rules. Each combination has a victory value which leads to a final assessment of game results. 

Players must recognize potential combinations and estimate the probability of obtaining the necessary cards to complete a desired combination. This probability must be weighed against the victory value of the combination. 

Since there are so many possible combinations, beyond the measure of normal human computation, the player's primary purpose in these games is the analysis of achievable combinations.

## Athletic Games
Emphasizes physical more than mental prowess. The rules explicitly specify a precise set of actions that the player is either allowed to execute or required to execute. Skillful use of the body is the player's primary concern in these games. 

There's a difference between an athletic game and an athletic competition. A race is competition, but not a game. A key distinction would be in a race, the runners do not interact with each other. Each is racing only against the clock; the presence of other runners should be immaterial. In reality, the runners do interact with each other psychologically, as the performance of one runner can affect the other runners. Nevertheless, this is still not a direct interaction between competitors, therefore do no constitute a game. A competition that does allow interaction is a game.
